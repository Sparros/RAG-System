Habeas corpus is a legal principle that protects individuals from unlawful detention. It allows a person held in custody to challenge the legality of their detention before a court.

The concept originated in English common law and became a fundamental safeguard of personal liberty. Habeas corpus requires authorities to justify imprisonment and prevents arbitrary or indefinite detention without legal process.

The principle has been incorporated into many legal systems worldwide and is considered a cornerstone of constitutional law and human rights protections.
