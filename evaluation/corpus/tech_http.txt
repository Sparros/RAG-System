The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol used for transmitting data on the World Wide Web. It defines how clients, such as web browsers, communicate with servers.

HTTP is based on a request-response model. Clients send requests specifying a method, such as GET or POST, and servers return responses containing status codes and content. Common status codes include 200 for success, 404 for not found, and 500 for server errors.

HTTP is stateless, meaning each request is independent. Extensions such as cookies and headers allow servers to maintain session-like behavior. Modern versions of HTTP, including HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, improve performance through multiplexing and reduced latency.
