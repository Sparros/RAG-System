Aspirin is the genericized trademark for acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to reduce pain, fever, and inflammation, and as an antithrombotic. Specific inflammatory conditions that aspirin is used to treat include Kawasaki disease, pericarditis, and rheumatic fever.

Aspirin is also used long-term to help prevent further heart attacks, ischaemic strokes, and blood clots in people at high risk. For pain or fever, effects typically begin within 30 minutes. Aspirin works similarly to other NSAIDs but also suppresses the normal functioning of platelets.

One common adverse effect is an upset stomach. More significant side effects include stomach ulcers, stomach bleeding, and worsening asthma. Bleeding risk is greater among those who are older, drink alcohol, take other NSAIDs, or are on other blood thinners. Aspirin is not recommended in the last part of pregnancy and is not generally recommended in children with viral infections because of the risk of Reye syndrome. High doses may result in ringing in the ears.

A precursor to aspirin found in the bark of the willow tree, salicin, is metabolized in the human gut into the medicinally active compound salicylic acid and has been used for its health effects for at least 2,400 years. Pharmacology later sought a synthetic alternative. In 1853, the chemist Charles Frédéric Gerhardt treated sodium salicylate with acetyl chloride to produce acetylsalicylic acid for the first time. Over the next 50 years, chemists, mostly associated with the German company Bayer, established the chemical structure and devised more efficient production methods. Felix Hoffmann of Bayer was the first to produce acetylsalicylic acid in a pure, stable form in 1897. By 1899, Bayer had named the drug Aspirin and was selling it globally.

Aspirin is available without medical prescription as a proprietary or generic medication in most jurisdictions. It is one of the most widely used medications globally, with tens of thousands of tonnes consumed each year, and is listed on the World Health Organization’s List of Essential Medicines. In 2023, it was among the most commonly prescribed medications in the United States.

Aspirin is an acetyl derivative of salicylic acid and is a white, crystalline, weakly acidic substance. It melts at approximately 136 degrees Celsius and decomposes around 140 degrees Celsius. Its acid dissociation constant (pKa) is about 3.5 at room temperature.

Aspirin exhibits polymorphism, meaning it can exist in more than one crystal structure. For many years, only one polymorphic form was known. In 2005, a second polymorph was identified during co-crystallization experiments. The different polymorphs vary in how aspirin molecules form hydrogen bonds with one another, although they share similar structural motifs. Additional polymorphic forms have been reported under high pressure or specialized conditions.
