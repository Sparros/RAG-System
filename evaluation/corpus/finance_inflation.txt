Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services rises over time, reducing the purchasing power of money. It is commonly measured using price indices such as the Consumer Price Index.

Moderate inflation is often associated with economic growth, while high or unpredictable inflation can cause economic instability. Central banks attempt to manage inflation through monetary policy tools such as interest rates.

Inflation can be caused by increased demand, rising production costs, or expansion of the money supply. Its effects include changes in wages, savings, investment decisions, and government policy.
