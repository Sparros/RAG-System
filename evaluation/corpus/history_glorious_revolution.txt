The Glorious Revolution was a political event in England that took place in 1688 and 1689, resulting in the overthrow of King James II and his replacement by William III and Mary II. It marked a decisive shift in the balance of power between the monarchy and Parliament.

The revolution was driven by concerns over James II’s policies, particularly his promotion of Roman Catholic interests in a predominantly Protestant country. His actions raised fears of absolutism and the erosion of parliamentary authority. The birth of a Catholic heir further intensified opposition.

In 1688, a group of English nobles invited William of Orange, a Protestant ruler from the Netherlands and husband of James’s daughter Mary, to intervene. William landed in England with an army, and James fled to France. Parliament declared that James had abdicated the throne.

The outcome of the Glorious Revolution included the establishment of constitutional monarchy and the passage of the Bill of Rights in 1689. This document limited royal powers and affirmed parliamentary sovereignty. The revolution had lasting influence on political thought and constitutional development in Britain and beyond.
