Compound interest refers to the process by which interest is added to the principal of a loan or investment, so that future interest is earned on both the original amount and the accumulated interest. This effect causes wealth to grow at an accelerating rate over time.

The formula for compound interest depends on the principal, interest rate, number of compounding periods, and time. Frequent compounding leads to greater total returns compared to simple interest.

Compound interest plays a central role in savings, investments, and debt. It benefits long-term investors but can significantly increase the cost of loans if interest accumulates over time.
