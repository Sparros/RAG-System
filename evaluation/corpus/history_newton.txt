Isaac Newton was an English mathematician, physicist, and astronomer who is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists in history. He was born in 1643 and made foundational contributions to classical mechanics, optics, and mathematics.

Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation, which described the movement of objects and the forces acting between them. These principles dominated scientific understanding for centuries and remain fundamental to physics education.

In mathematics, Newton independently developed calculus as a method for analyzing change and motion. His work in optics demonstrated that white light is composed of a spectrum of colors and led to the development of the reflecting telescope.

Newton served as president of the Royal Society and later as Warden and Master of the Royal Mint. His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica is considered one of the most important works in the history of science.
